# running netstat -nlp | grep nginx, i observed it was running on port 8080
# then i checked if the configrations are alright, i checked /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
# and the server was runnig on port 8080, so i created a symoblic link to /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
# which has the correct config and restarted the service
ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
